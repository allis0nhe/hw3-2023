/*
  * Instructions
  * Write CSS so the information below displays properly. Do not change any HTML
  *
  * Part 1: List of cities by population
  *       Make every even entry on the list (#2, #4, #6, etc.) black text (#000) on a
  *        dark blue background (#376F70).
  *        Make every odd entry on the list (#1, #3, #5, etc.) black text (#000) on a light blue
  *          background  (#BEEEEF)
  *        Make every tenth entry (#10, #20, #30) have 50px of white space after it for clarity, but not
  *          if it is the last entry.
  *       TIP! Think about how you might be able to use nth-child(), first-child, or last-child?
  *
  * Part 2: Photos with hover
  *       Make all images have a 5px black border, 10px margin, and display in-line.
  *       Make all images have a dark blue (#376F70) shadow only when being hovered over.
  *       Make all elements that have focus have a dark blue (#376F70) shadow.
  *       Challenge!!  Can you alter the html so that images can have a focus state.  (It is a good idea to 
  *       account for focus whenever you style for hover.)
  *
  * Part 3: Test your work!
  *       Take your style sheet and copy it into the test-your-work styles folder. Open test-your-work.html
  *         Does the list format correctly even though it has more list items?
  *         Do the images all have a hover effect even though they have classes, Ids?
  *         Do all elements, including the buttons, have a shadow when focused?
  *       If you wrote your CSS correctly, it should work without you having to make any changes!
  *
  * You can do it! (*•̀ᴗ•́*)و
